About: 
In this repository, you'll find the code used to analyze the mock community data that Mandy generated (abundance files, depth files, sequencing statistics).

Instructions: 
1. Clone this repo to your own computer. 
2. Upload the depth files* to the raw_data folders, for the appropriate runs.
3. Run the scipts in the code file, in order (1-6).
4. The scripts should generate files for the processed_data folder and for the figures folder. 

*Caution: 
The depth files were too large to upload to this repository. For depth files, please see Mandy.
